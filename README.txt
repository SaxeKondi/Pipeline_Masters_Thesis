This repository contains all code components used in the thesis. Note that only the code files are included here. Data files and other large resources are not in the repo.

The folders are organized by thesis component, not as a runnable pipeline. Each top-level directory corresponds to a section in the thesis.

This project includes code from https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet (released under GPL 3.0). All code in this repository is therefore licensed under GPL 3.0.
